# Mr. Clean ðŸ«§

A Raycast script that automatically organizes files and folders by their creation date.

## Features

- Organizes files into folders based on creation month (YYYY-MM format)
- Automatically archives folders older than 6 months into an `_archive` directory
- Works with the current Finder window or a specified directory path
- Leaves a friendly timestamp when cleaning is complete

## Prerequisites

- macOS
- [Raycast](https://raycast.com/) installed
- Bash shell

## Install
- copy mr-clean-v1.0.sh into your raycast script directory
- run `chmod +x mr-clean-v1.0.sh` to make the script executable


## Usage

### Clean a dir - via Raycast

1. Open Raycast
2. Type "Mr. Clean"
3. Optionally provide a directory path, or leave blank to use current Finder window
4. Confirm the action

#### Directory Structure

The script will organize your files into the following structure:
```
your-directory/
â”œâ”€â”€ 2024-03/
â”œâ”€â”€ 2024-02/
â”œâ”€â”€ 2024-01/
â”œâ”€â”€ _archive/
â”‚ â”œâ”€â”€ 2023-09/
â”‚ â”œâ”€â”€ 2023-08/
â”‚ â””â”€â”€ ...
â””â”€â”€ mr_clean_was_here.txt
```

### Undo a clean - via Raycast

1. Open Raycast
2. Type "Mr. Clean"
3. Optionally provide a directory path, or leave blank to use current Finder window
4. Type "u" or "undo" for the second optional argument
5. Confirm action

## How It Works

1. If no directory is specified, the script uses the current Finder window location
2. Files and folders are sorted into monthly directories (YYYY-MM format)
3. Monthly folders older than 6 months are moved to the `_archive` directory
4. A timestamp file (`mr_clean_was_here.txt`) is created in the source directory
5. If undoing a clean, target the directory structure will be flattened, back to it's original state.
